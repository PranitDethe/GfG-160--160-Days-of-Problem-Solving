# Minimum Weight Cycle

## Problem Statement

Given an undirected, weighted graph with `V` vertices numbered from `0` to `V-1` and `E` edges, represented by a 2D array `edges[][]`, where `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` represents the edge between the nodes `u` and `v` having `w` edge weight.

Your task is to find the **minimum weight cycle** in this graph.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
V = 5  
edges[][] = `[[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [1, 3, 1], [1, 4, 1], [0, 4, 3], [2, 3, 4]]`

**Output:**  
`6`

**Explanation:**  
Minimum-weighted cycle is `0 → 1 → 4 → 0` with a total weight of 6 `(2 + 1 + 3)`.

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
V = 5  
edges[][] = `[[0, 1, 3], [1, 2, 2], [0, 4, 1], [1, 4, 2], [1, 3, 1], [3, 4, 2], [2, 3, 3]]`

**Output:**  
`5`

**Explanation:**  
Minimum-weighted cycle is `1 → 3 → 4 → 1` with a total weight of 5 `(1 + 2 + 2)`.

## Constraints:
- `1 ≤ V ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ E = edges.size() ≤ 10^3`
- `1 ≤ edges[i][j] ≤ 100`
