# Pair with Given Sum in a Sorted Array

## Problem Description
You are given an integer target and an array arr[]. You have to find the number of pairs in arr[] which sum up to the target.  
It is given that the elements of arr[] are in sorted order.  
**Note:** Pairs should have elements of distinct indexes.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
arr[] = [-1, 1, 5, 5, 7], target = 6  
**Output:**  
3  
**Explanation:**  
There are 3 pairs which sum up to 6: {1, 5}, {1, 5}, and {-1, 7}.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 2  
**Output:**  
6  
**Explanation:**  
There are 6 pairs which sum up to 2: {1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}, {1, 1}, and {1, 1}.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
arr[] = [-1, 10, 10, 12, 15], target = 125  
**Output:**  
0  
**Explanation:**  
There is no such pair which sums up to 125.

## Constraints
- -10^5 <= target <= 10^5  
- 2 <= arr.size() <= 10^5  
- -10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
