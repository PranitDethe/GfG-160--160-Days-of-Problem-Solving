# Maximum Path Sum from Any Node

## Problem Statement  
Given a **binary tree**, the task is to find the **maximum path sum**. The path may start and end at **any** node in the tree.

## Examples  

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
root[] = [10, 2, 10, 20, 1, N, -25, N, N, N, N, 3, 4]

**Output:**  
42

**Explanation:**  
The **maximum path sum** is represented using green-colored nodes in the binary tree.

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
root[] = [-17, 11, 4, 20, -2, 10]

**Output:**  
31

**Explanation:**  
The **maximum path sum** is represented using green-colored nodes in the binary tree.

## Constraints  
- **1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10³**  
- **-10⁴ ≤ node->data ≤ 10⁴**
