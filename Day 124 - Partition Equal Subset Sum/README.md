# Partition Equal Subset Sum


## Problem Statement
Given an array `arr[]`, determine if it can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

**Note:** Each element must be in exactly one subset.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 5, 11, 5]`

**Output:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
The two parts are `[1, 5, 5]` and `[11]`.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`arr = [1, 3, 5]`

**Output:**  
`false`

**Explanation:**  
This array can never be partitioned into two such parts.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 200`
