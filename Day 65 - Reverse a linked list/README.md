## Problem Description
Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list and return the new head of the reversed list.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL  

**Output:**  
head: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL  

**Explanation:**  
The linked list is reversed, with the last node becoming the new head.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
head: 2 -> 7 -> 10 -> 9 -> 8 -> NULL  

**Output:**  
head: 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 7 -> 2 -> NULL  

**Explanation:**  
The linked list is reversed, and all node connections are flipped.

---

### Example 3
**Input:**  
head: 10 -> NULL  

**Output:**  
head: 10 -> NULL  

**Explanation:**  
Since there is only one node, the reversed linked list remains the same.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10⁵  
- 1 ≤ data of nodes ≤ 10⁵
