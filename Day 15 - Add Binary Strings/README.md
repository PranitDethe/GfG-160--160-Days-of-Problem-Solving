# Add Binary Strings

This problem involves finding the binary sum of two binary strings and returning the resultant binary string without leading zeros.

---

## Problem Statement

Given two binary strings `s1` and `s2`, consisting only of `0`s and `1`s, calculate the binary sum of the two strings. The output should not have any leading zeros.

---

### Examples

#### Example 1
- **Input**: 
  - `s1 = "1101"`
  - `s2 = "111"`
- **Output**: `10100`

#### Example 2
- **Input**:
  - `s1 = "00100"`
  - `s2 = "010"`
- **Output**: `110`

---

### Constraints

1. `1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 10^6`
2. The input strings `s1` and `s2` may contain leading zeros.
