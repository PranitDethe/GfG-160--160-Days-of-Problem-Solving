# Fixing Two Nodes of a BST

## Problem Statement  
Given the **root** of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** where exactly **two nodes** were **swapped by mistake**, your task is to **fix (or correct) the BST** by swapping them back.  
Do **not** change the structure of the tree.  

**Note:**  
- It is **guaranteed** that the given input will form a BST **except** for the two swapped nodes.  
- All changes must be **reflected in the original BST**.

## Examples  

### Example 1  
**Input:**  
root = [10, 5, 8, 2, 20]


**Output:**  
1

**Explanation:**  
The nodes **20** and **8** were swapped by mistake.

### Example 2  
**Input:**  
root = [5, 10, 20, 2, 8]

**Output:**  
1

**Explanation:**  
The nodes **10** and **5** were swapped by mistake.

## Constraints  
- **1 ≤ Number of nodes ≤ 10³**
